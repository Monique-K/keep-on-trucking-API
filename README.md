KEEP ON TRUCKIN' BACKEND API
===

## Getting Started

Please note: you will want to have the API running before you run up the front end of this project, otherwise your driver map will be unpopulated.

Navigate to the directory where you would like to save the project. 

Run `git clone git@github.com:Monique-K/keep-on-trucking-API.git`. The project will be downloaded into a folder called `keep-on-trucking-API`. 

Go into that folder and run `npm install` to download all dependencies. 

Run `npm start` to start the API server. 

Now you're ready to start the front end. Instructions are at [Keep on Truckin'](https://github.com/Monique-K/keep-on-trucking)
